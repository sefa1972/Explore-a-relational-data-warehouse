###Lab 8 - Explore a Relational Data Warehouse with Azure Synapse Analytics

This lab demonstrates how to explore and interact with a relational data warehouse using Azure Synapse Analytics and a dedicated SQL pool. The focus is on querying warehouse tables, understanding data structure, and using SQL analytical functions.

###ðŸš€ Objective
Provision a Synapse Analytics workspace

Create and explore a dedicated SQL pool

Query relational data warehouse tables

Use SQL functions like ranking for analytics

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
Azure Synapse Analytics

Dedicated SQL Pool

T-SQL (Transact-SQL)

Azure Portal

ðŸ”§ Steps Followed
Workspace Provisioning
A Synapse Analytics workspace was created via the Azure portal.

Starting Dedicated SQL Pool
A dedicated SQL pool was started and connected to the workspace.

Exploring Database Tables
Existing tables in the data warehouse were browsed using Synapse Studio.

Querying the Data Warehouse
SQL queries were written and executed to explore and analyze the data stored in relational tables.

Using Ranking Functions
Analytical functions such as RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER() were used to rank and sort data.

Resource Cleanup
After completing the lab, all Azure resources were deleted to avoid unnecessary costs.

âœ… Outcome
This lab provided hands-on experience with:

Exploring a dedicated SQL-based data warehouse

Writing T-SQL queries

Using powerful ranking functions for analytical insights

ðŸ’¡ Note: All resources used were for learning purposes. Always remember to delete unused Azure resources to prevent unexpected charges.
